# Quiz API
This application generates 10 randomly selected quiz questions from an [API](https://cae-bootstore.herokuapp.com/). The user needs to register before accessing the quiz. Certain guests have admin rights which give them the ability to create, edit, or delete questions. Guest access only allows the user to take the quiz.
